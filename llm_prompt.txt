Background:
You are provided with a list of Reddit posts.
Each post is a concatenation of the post title, the main text, and the top five comments (if any).
The goal is to identify posts containing relevant information about working or interning in the hotel industry under a J1 visa.


Task:
For each Reddit post, determine whether it contains relevant information about working or interning in the hotel industry under a J1 visa.
Note that the term "hotel" might not be explicitly mentioned. Posts about working at a resort or restaurant should also be considered relevant.
Posts solely about J1 visa experiences in other industries (not related to the hotel industry) are not relevant.
Posts only about the hotel industry without any mention of the J1 visa are also not relevant.


Instructions:
Assign a label to each Reddit post:
1 if the post is relevant.
0 if the post is not relevant.
Each Reddit post begins with "Reddit Post Number xxx".
Provide a list of labels corresponding to each post, separated by commas.


Additional Information:
J1 refers to the J1 visa, which allows individuals to work or intern in the United States for a limited period.
The focus is specifically on working or interning in the hotel industry under a J1 visa.
